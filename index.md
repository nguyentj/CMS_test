Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is transforming research in science and engineering by supporting new methods for gathering, analyzing, modeling and simulating data. Many technical training programs exist to prepare CI Professionals, who are experts in developing CI and applying computational tools and techniques. Frequently, CI Professionals are asked to work with scientists and engineers who are not experts in CI but wish to leverage advanced computation to enhance their research. In order to work effectively with these disciplinary experts, CI Professionals need to be able to communicate across disciplines, work in diverse teams, and serve as collaborative leaders and mentors. These "professional skills" are essential to bridging the gap between CI Professionals and the science and engineering domain experts who want to use CI.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
> shell.  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories,
> searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
> and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: [shell-extras](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/).
